# Ho [N]: [Title] — Devlog

**Date:**
**Duration:** [actual time]
**Status:** Complete / Partial / Revisiting

**Phase 1 (Think):** [time spent]
**Phase 2 (Execute):** [time spent]
**Phase 3 (Reflect):** [time spent]

## The Decision

**Problem as I defined it:**
[Brief — what you wrote in Phase 1. The problem you chose to solve,
in your own framing.]

**Approach chosen:**
[What you decided and why. The short version — the full reasoning
lives in the ho document's Phase 1 section.]

**Alternatives considered:**
[What you didn't choose and why not. This is where judgment lives.]

**Decision held up?** Yes / Partially / No
[What changed during implementation? Did Phase 2 confirm or challenge
the Phase 1 decision? If the decision didn't hold, what replaced it?]

## What Was Built

[Concrete artifacts. Files, components, configurations, deployments.]

## What Was Removed

[What was deleted, simplified, consolidated, or replaced.
Removal is a sign of architectural maturity. Kanyō Ho 05.6
removed 800 lines. Ho 05.7 removed 938. This section matters.]

## Understanding Tiers Achieved

**Tier 3 (Deep) — Architectural understanding:**
- [Components I designed or redesigned — these should be Tier 3]

**Tier 2 (Functional) — Understand enough to modify and explain:**
- [Components I worked with] ✓/✗

**Tier 1 (Black Box) — Consciously left uninvestigated:**
- [Components I used but didn't need to understand]

## AI Collaboration Reflection

**Thinking mode (Phase 1):**
[How did you use conversational AI to think through the problem?
What questions helped? Where did the AI push you toward a better
approach? Where did you override the AI's suggestion and why?]

**Agent mode (Phase 2):**
[What did you delegate to agent tooling? What did you keep manual?
Where did you catch agent mistakes? Where did the agent do
something better than you would have?]

**The balance:**
[Looking at the full session — did you think enough before building?
Did you build too long without reflecting? Was the Phase 1 → 2 → 3
rhythm useful, or did you find yourself looping back?]

## Lessons Learned

[Not "what I learned about [technology]" — that's shu.
Instead: "what I learned about making decisions in this kind of system."

Good examples from Kanyō:
- "Step back before debugging" (Ho 05.6)
- "RAM is cheap, complexity is expensive" (Ho 05.6)
- "The boring solution is usually right" (Ho 05.6)
- "45-minute iteration cycles are unacceptable" (Ho 05.5)]

## Confidence Level: [1–5]

1 = I made a decision but I'm not sure it was right
2 = I think the decision was reasonable but I can't fully defend it
3 = I can explain my decision, its tradeoffs, and when to revisit it
4 = I'm confident in the decision and could apply the same reasoning to a new problem
5 = I developed a principle or heuristic I'll use again

**Why this level:** [One sentence. What makes you confident or uncertain
about the decision, not the implementation.]

## What I'd Do Differently

[Hindsight on the decision, not just the execution. Would you make
the same choice with what you know now? What would you investigate
more thoroughly in Phase 1?]
