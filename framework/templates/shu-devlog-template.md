# Ho [N]: [Title] — Devlog

**Date:**
**Duration:** [actual time vs. ~2 hour target]
**Status:** Complete / Partial / Blocked

---

## What Was Built

[List the concrete artifacts produced — files created, configurations written,
services deployed, tests passing. Be specific: "created src/kanyo/detection/detector.py"
not "worked on detection."]

## Understanding Tiers Achieved

**Tier 1 (Black Box) — Used without investigating:**
- [Component]: [What I know about using it, nothing more — and that's fine]

**Tier 2 (Functional) — Understand enough to modify and explain:**
- [Component]: ✓/✗ [Brief note on what understanding looks like]

**Tier 3 (Deep) — Architectural understanding:**
- [Component]: [If applicable — most shu hos won't have Tier 3]

## Challenges Encountered

[What went wrong. What took longer than expected. What confused you.
Be specific: "Docker volume mounts confused me for 45 minutes because
I was mounting to /app/config but the code expected /config" not
"had some trouble with Docker."]

## Key Learnings

[What you know now that you didn't know before this ho.
Not "I learned about pytest" but "I learned that pytest discovers tests
by filename convention (test_*.py), which means naming matters."
Specific insights, not topic labels.]

## AI Collaboration Reflection

[How did you use AI in this session?
- What did you accept without questioning?
- Where did you slow down and think instead of accepting AI output?
- Did you catch any AI mistakes? What were they?
- Was there a moment where you understood something better BECAUSE
  you questioned the AI's approach?]

## Files Created/Modified

[Complete list. This becomes useful reference when something breaks later.]

```
created:  src/kanyo/detection/detector.py
created:  tests/test_detector.py
modified: config.yaml
modified: README.md
```

## Confidence Level: [1–5]

1 = I followed instructions but don't really understand what happened
2 = I understand the broad strokes but couldn't reproduce without guidance
3 = I could explain this to someone and troubleshoot basic issues
4 = I understand this well and could extend it independently
5 = I could teach this and make non-obvious design decisions

**Why this level:** [One sentence explaining your rating. "3 because I understand
the pipeline but couldn't tune the detection thresholds without trial and error."]

## What I'd Do Differently

[Hindsight. Not self-criticism — honest calibration.
What would a second attempt look like?]
