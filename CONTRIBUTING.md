# Contributing to The Ho System

This is a living methodology. It gets stronger with evidence from practice.

## What We're Looking For

**Practice reports.** You used the Ho System on a real project. What worked? What didn't? What would you change? Even a paragraph is valuable. A full project arc with devlogs is gold.

**Template feedback.** You used a template and found a gap, a confusing section, or something that should be there but isn't. Tell us what and why.

**Structural critique.** You read the framework and found an inconsistency, an unsupported claim, or a concept that doesn't hold up under pressure. We'd rather hear it than not.

## How to Share

**Open an issue.** Describe what you tried, what happened, and what you think the framework should do differently. Evidence over opinion — link to repos, quote devlogs, show the work.

**Start a discussion.** For broader questions about the methodology, design philosophy, or potential applications outside software development.

We're not accepting pull requests on framework documents at this stage. The methodology is still being validated through its second pilot (Hōzō), and structural changes need to be grounded in evidence from practice. That said, if you've found a typo or broken link, an issue is welcome.

## What We're Not Looking For

- AI-generated summaries or reviews of the framework
- Requests to remove the non-commercial license
- "Have you considered using [other methodology]?" without substantive comparison
